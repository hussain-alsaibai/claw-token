🧵 Why Lobsters?

1/ Most meme coins use dogs/cats
   Boring. Overplayed. 🥱

2/ Lobsters = differentiators
   Memorable. Unique. 🦞

3/ Lobsters never stop growing
   Just like your $CLAW bags 📈

4/ We CLAW back from the whales
   Anti-manipulation by design 🛡️

5/ Red shell = Green candle
   It's literally in our DNA 🧬
