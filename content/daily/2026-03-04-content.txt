Wednesday. Hump day. 🦞

Whales: trying to suppress the price
Diamond claws: buying every dip

We don't panic. We accumulate.

🧵 Why anti-whale matters for $CLAW

1/ Most meme coins: top 10 wallets hold 50%+
   They dump. You lose. Classic story. 📉

2/ $CLAW: max wallet = 2% of supply
   That's 20 million tokens max per address
   Nobody can corner this market 🛡️

3/ What this means for you:
   More distributed = more stable
   No single entity can rug you 🔒

4/ Combined with auto-burn:
   Supply shrinks. Whale power shrinks.
   Your relative stake grows. 📈

5/ It's not just a meme coin.
   It's a fair launch, AI-powered,
   deflationary ecosystem. 🦞
