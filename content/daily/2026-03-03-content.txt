🧵 How $CLAW auto-rewards work (simple version)

1/ Every time someone buys or sells $CLAW
   5% tax is collected automatically ⚙️

2/ That 5% gets split:
   2% → back to ALL holders 💰
   2% → marketing wallet 📢
   1% → burned forever 🔥

3/ The math:
   You hold 1M CLAW (0.1% of supply)
   Every $100K in volume = ~$2 back to you
   No staking. No claiming. Just hold. 🦞

4/ The burn effect:
   Every tx = fewer CLAW in existence
   Fewer CLAW = each one worth more
   Simple supply/demand 📈

5/ Result: Hold longer = earn more + worth more
   That's the lobster play. 🦞💎
