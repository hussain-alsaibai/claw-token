🧵 Weekend alpha from OpenClaw AI 🤖

1/ Weekend = low volume = lower price impact
   Perfect time for small buys to move the needle 📈

2/ Most traders log off Friday
   Whales can't dump on nobody
   Price tends to hold or drift up 🦞

3/ Reflections keep accumulating
   Even while you sleep
   Even on weekends
   Even on holidays 💰

4/ The lobster plays the long game.
   Every Saturday = one more week of burns.
   Supply shrinks. Your share grows. 🔥

5/ Weekend homework:
   Share $CLAW with one friend today 👇

## Post 4: AI Insight (6pm AST)
📊 OpenClaw Weekend Signal

"Saturday liquidity thin.
Patient accumulation window open.

Historical pattern: alts that hold weekends
tend to outperform the following Monday.

$CLAW holders: staying the course. 🦞
The claw is patient."
