🧵 What makes $CLAW different from every other meme coin?

1/ Most meme coins: celebrity shills, rug, repeat
   $CLAW: built by AI, for the community 🤖

2/ Most meme coins: whale dumping enabled
   $CLAW: 2% max wallet, anti-whale by design 🛡️

3/ Most meme coins: holders get nothing
   $CLAW: 2% of every tx goes back to you 💰

4/ Most meme coins: inflationary forever
   $CLAW: 1% burn per tx = fewer tokens = more value 🔥

5/ The lobster thesis:
   Hard shell. Never backs down.
   Keeps growing. Diamond claws. 🦞💎
